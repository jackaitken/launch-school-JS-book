// '5' + 10 == '510'

/* 
For a given expression that attempts to concatenate a String and a Number
JavaScript uses implicit type coercion to coerce the Number to a String.

The '+' operator in this case is concatenating '5' and '10', not adding
them. Therefore instead of equalling 15, the concatenated String is '510'
